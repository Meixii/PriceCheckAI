# Magkano po, Philippines Medicine Price Checker

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a centralized application so that the users are able to intelligently compare prices across pharmaceutical companies in the Philippines. It is also for local pharmacies to be able to competitively price their product against other companies and to be able to extract the results from the data and further use it in their businesses.

## Project Structure
This project is created with Express, React-Vite and Electron / Electron Forge. This application does not store any data in a database because the application simply checks the prices based on when the 'search pharmacies' has been clicked and I personally don't see any reason to have a database to store the data that is being gathered.

## Maintainers
I'm the sole maintainer of this project, if you want to be contribute in this project you may do so by forking this application and creating a pull request
